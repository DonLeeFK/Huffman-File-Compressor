# Huffman-File-Compressor
This is file compressor based on Huffman Tree. It works pretty well with less information dense file format such as plain text. But suffers when compressing high information dense file like audio or video. 
Although the compression might not as effctive as any related app you can download from internet, but my algorithm applies a very unique way of build a huffman tree, so theoretically only this very same program could decompress a cpompressed file generated by my program. So you can use this program as a encryption method.
